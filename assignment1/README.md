Details about this assignment can be found [on the course webpage](http://cs231n.github.io/), under Assignment #1 of Winter 2016 [link](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment1/).

##Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points)

The IPython Notebook [`knn.ipynb`](https://github.com/kingtaurus/cs231n/blob/master/assignment1/knn.ipynb/) will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

##Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points)

The IPython Notebook [`svm.ipynb`](https://github.com/kingtaurus/cs231n/blob/master/assignment1/svm.ipynb/) will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

##Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points)

The IPython Notebook [`softmax.ipynb`](https://github.com/kingtaurus/cs231n/blob/master/assignment1/softmax.ipynb/)  will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

##Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points)

The IPython Notebook [`two_layer_net.ipynb`](https://github.com/kingtaurus/cs231n/blob/master/assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb/) will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

##Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points)

The IPython Notebook [`features.ipynb`](https://github.com/kingtaurus/cs231n/blob/master/assignment1/features.ipynb/) will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

##Q6: Cool Bonus: Do something extra! (+10 points)

Implement, investigate or analyze something extra surrounding the topics in this assignment, and using the code you developed. For example, is there some other interesting question we could have asked? Is there any insightful visualization you can plot? Or anything fun to look at? Or maybe you can experiment with a spin on the loss function? If you try out something cool we'll give you up to 10 extra points and may feature your results in the lecture.
